// ═══════════════════ THE RECALL ═══════════════════
// A word (or letters) flashes briefly, then vanishes into a field of
// drifting decoy letters for a delay before the recall question appears.
// Difficulty ramps across 4 tiers of 10 questions: color recall, then
// word recall, then position recall, then multi-letter color+position
// binding — with the flash getting shorter and the delay getting longer.
